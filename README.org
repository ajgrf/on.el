#+TITLE: on.el -- utility hooks and functions from Doom Emacs

This package exposes a number of utility hooks and functions ported
from Doom Emacs. The hooks make it easier to speed up Emacs startup
by providing finer-grained control of the timing at which packages
are loaded.

For example, =use-package= users can delay loading the =which-key=
package until the first key is pressed:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key
  :hook (on-first-input . which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

In addition to =on-first-input-hook=, =on.el= also provides
=on-first-file-hook= and =on-first-buffer-hook=.
